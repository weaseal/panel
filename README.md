# Panel Library
This is a golang API client library for interacting with Nanoleaf Canvas tiles.  See [sample.go](sample/sample.go) for usage examples.

See GoDoc for detailed library documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/weaseal/panel

Currently, you can use this library to interact with the Canvas tile in the following ways:
- toggle on/off
- brightness
- colour tempeature
- hue / saturation

Basically, you can set the panel to any solid color & brightness combination.  It does not yet support other modes, such as effects.  PRs welcome!

## TODO
- tests
